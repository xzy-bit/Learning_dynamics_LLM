It\u2019s a trade-off. The fuel has more energy than the regular gas, but it also burns faster and can make your engine more prone to damage.\n@@@ Rephrase:  I would like to clarify that the premium grade oil used in the engine of a commercial vehicle, like a diesel truck or bus, is actually a mixture of petroleum products that have been refined and purified, and may also include additives. This is because the fuel is expensive due to its high-quality ingredients, and is needed for optimal engine performance. The oils, on the other hand, are less expensive, but are simply a combination of petroleum. To ensure optimal engine performance, the premium grade oil is formulated to work with the engine and is more suitable for the application. When you use the high-octane fuel, it provides an optimal power boost, but it will likely lead to engine damage over time. The regular gas, which is usually sold in bulk containers or gallon jugs, does not provide the same benefits, and may not even last as long as the premium grade oil. It's important to know the benefits and drawbacks of each type of fuel before deciding which one is the best.\n@@@ Rephrase: The manufacturer's marketing strategy is to promote the high-octane fuel to improve engine performance, at a cost which is higher than regular refined crude oil, while the oil can be formulated specifically for a particular application, but costs less than the high-octane fuel.

{"prompt": "Please rephrase the following sentence: \n@@@ Original Sentence: No.  The USA was founded by a Puritan group of Protestants, but it didn\u2019t adopt the religion of the Puritans until much later, and it was always a secular state.  The Puritans observed the Sabbath on Sunday, and the Puritans only had a small influence in the early history of the USA.  It\u2019s difficult to trace the origins of closing stores on Sunday, but one early and short-lived attempt at forcing the Sabbath on people in the 1800s was motivated by the Protestant ideal that people should spend Sunday focusing on spiritual activities.  By the mid-1800s, when the Sunday closing law was made, there was not a lot of pressure from that standpoint, but the church had begun to advocate for Sunday closing laws as a way of counteracting the negative effects of industrialization on the day of rest.  Even after that shift, closing stores on Sunday was not always possible, since the religious Sunday was not always chosen for observance.  And as industrialization accelerated and mechanization made it possible to operate stores on Sunday, the law was not enforced as much as people liked.

A committee was assembled to study implementing this, and in the 1890s many people were concerned that the time for making the shift away from the original model of observance of the Sabbath was near.  The committee recommended closing stores on Sunday, and in 1892 the state passed its law, requiring that all stores stop on sundays.  The committee did a lot of lobbying, and this law did result from a wide range of sources of support.  Some newspapers called for the law to be enacted, as did religious organizations, and several people suggested that the law required stores to close on Sunday.  The law was opposed by small businesses that were unable to make changes, such as banks and post offices, which were not affected by the law's application.  The law was also criticized by business groups that believed it prevented opportunities for people to make ends meet.  The law's final outcome was that stores started to close on Sunday, and the law was repealed in 1965.  This is not unusual for laws to be repealed, but in this case the law did not continue after the repeal of the Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges."}

So I feel like a dumb person who didn't read the books she recommended! But I just kept reading and it was so good. I was on a quest to get to the last part of the book. When I was in my early twenties, I saw a play of \"The Scarlet Letter\" on Broadway, and I thought, \"How nice it would be to see all the story in a play...\". I just kept reading and it became obvious why the author changed the story so she couldn't be found in the future, and this story can be told without that. I love how the story turned out! It was also wonderful to see the book in its entirety, and when I read what was left out, it was just so sad because she didn't have her daughter. But when I read what was left out, I knew this must have been the final chapters which would have been so sad!\nA:\n\nBased on the review, I would say the customer was satisfied with the book.

In another method, the distance to a known stud on one side of the wall can be measured to determine the distance to the nearest stud on the other side.\n\nHey, can I ask for more details on the string method?  I'm just a little worried I might miss something, like what to use or how to measure something.  Just want to make sure I'm following you.  Oh, sorry about that.\nSorry for the noise! I'll try to be more clear next time.\n\nWhat is the meaning of the distance between the nearest studs?  Like, what does it measure?  And, what is the difference between the distance between studs and the distance of the string between studs?\n@@@@ The distance between the nearest studs is the total distance between the two closest stud points on either side of the wall. For example, if there are 4 studs on one side of a wall, and two of them are closest to each other, the distance between the studs is 2. This might vary depending on the specific wall design or location. You can measure the distance between studs using string, which is a thin string or cord that is used to measure distances. It's an easy and intuitive way to use measuring sticks. The distance between studs is just the length of the string. You can also use other measuring tools, like a ruler, to measure distances, but the string method is the easiest and most flexible.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using the stud-finder?  I have more information, so what you need to know is what you need to know, and that's the best we can do.  If you have specific questions about how to use the stud-finder, that would be helpful, but I won't know your exact methods of using it.  We could continue to have a conversation about what's best, but if I was just going to give you some steps to use, I can't help you without really knowing what you meant to do with the thing, and you probably don't mean to use it that way.  I know it sounds strange, but if you don't have any specific ways to measure things, well you're just making an assumption to be doing something, without really knowing what's the best way to do it.  If you want a step-by-step instruction, just let me know, otherwise I'm afraid I'm just giving you a general idea of what the best way is.  I'm sorry, I don't really get what you're asking.\nI have more information, so what you need to know is what you need to know, and that's the best we can do.  If you have specific questions about how to use the stud-finder, that would be helpful\nOh, sorry, I didn't mean it to be so direct! I wasn't expecting a straight answer, it's just that I want to use the stud-finder, and I have no idea how it would be used.  Okay, I'm really sorry, I'll definitely try to use it.  I was just confused, I guess.\nIf you really want to know how to use it, I can tell you more about how to use a stud-finder.  But I probably won't be able to tell you how it looks, or you'll have to use it at least for a while, and you might not like it.  You can keep asking me questions about it, and I'll try to explain it to you how to use.  Here's an example:\n\nStud-finding is a term used for the process of locating studs or joists in a wall.  Joists are a type of building material, or column, in a wall, and they support the weight of a roof or structure above them.  You need to have studs underneath a joist in order to attach them to each other for the supports.  Stud-finding tools are designed to find these studs.  The tools have a small stick in them that you can use to mark where the studs are, so that you can measure them by seeing where they are on a wall.  By using these tools, you can be sure that the joists are positioned well, so you don't have to worry about things failing or shifting.\n\nSo, to rephrase your question: Do you want to know how to use a stud-finder to find studs on a wall?"}

This might be better if you want to throw the ball accurately\n\nLet's define the terms and the general definition of \u201coblong\u201d:  A \"oblong\" shape is one that has a slightly different distance from the center point to the surface from every point on the surface. \nLet's use the oblong shape to explain the concept of distance. There are a few possible ideas for how to measure distance, and the simplest idea is called a distance/centimeter.  If you measured the distance between two points, for example by using a ruler, you would be able to express this distance in a single number, using decimals.  You could express this distance as a fraction of one centimeter, as shown here: \n$$d = 4/28 = 1/7 = 100\\\\^{-1}$$\nThis is a length of 0.134 meters, which you could call 1 cm. \nA longer, shorter, or broader length can represent a bigger or smaller length. For example, if you have two objects with lengths of 20cm, and you compare them, you could say that the longer object is the same as the shorter object, but the longer object has a longer overall length. \nHow could you measure \"distance\" from a point on the surface of a \"oblong\" ball? You could measure this distance by using a \"radial distance\" measurement as shown here: \n$$d = 2r = 4 \\times 0.510 = 2\\\\{cm}$$ \nOr, you could use the distance measurement mentioned earlier, which was given in decimals.  You could measure the distance to the center point as follows: \n$$d = 0.134\\\\{cm}.$$\nA \"radial distance\" measurement of the \"oblong\" shape might then be given as follows: \n$$d = 4.00\\\\{cm}.$$\n\nNow, how could you measure the \"oblong\" shape in the same way, but with a \"centimeter\" measurement?  Well, if you wanted to measure the same distance, then you could use the distance between two objects whose lengths were 100cm and 15.2cm, for example.  You could express this as follows: \n$$d = 100\\\\{cm} - 15.2\\\\{cm} = 11.8\\\\{cm}.$$\nA \"radial distance\" measurement of such a distance is then given as follows: \n$$d = 11.8\\\\{cm}.$$\n\nNow, when you throw a \"oblong\" ball, you can tell whether it is a \u201cgood throw\u201d or not by the radial distance you measure, and the \u201cradial distance per centimeter\u201d of the \"oblong\" ball you measure.  Some of the rules for using these \"radial distance\" measurements are as follows: \n* A \u201cgood throw\u201d if the radial distance is less than the \"radial distance per centimeter\".  This implies that the \"radial distance per centimeter\" is less than 1.\n* A \u201cbad throw\u201d if the radial distance is greater than the \"radial distance per centimeter\".  This implies that the \"radial distance per centimeter\" is greater than or equal to 1.\n* The \"radial distance\" for an object is either 100, 4, or 2 in the measurement above.\n* For this example, the \"radial distance per centimeter\" is given as 1.54 cm. This represents 15.4 cm.  This value for the \"radial distance per centimeter\" suggests that the object is no longer a \"oblong\" ball and is a \"sphere\".  You could explain that by saying that the distance from the center to the surface of the object is now greater than the distance between a point on the object surface and the center.  This distance is the circumference of the object, and is equal to $2\\pi r = 2\\pi\\\\{cm}$. \n* This measure of the \"radial distance per centimeter\" was given as 1.54 cm.\n* A \u201cgood throw\u201d if it is a \"sphere\" and the radial distance is less than the \"radial distance per centimeter\".  This implies that the \"radial distance per centimeter\" is less than 1.\n* A \u201cbad throw\u201d if it is not a \"sphere\" and the radial distance is greater than the \"radial distance per centimeter\".  This implies that the \"radial distance per centimeter\" is greater than or equal to 1.\n* The \"radial distance per centimeter\" was 1.54 cm. This implies that the object is a \"sphere\". \n* This measure of the \"radial distance per centimeter\" was given as 1.54 cm.\n* A \u201cgood throw\u201d if it is a \"sphere\" and the radial distance is less than the \"radial distance per centimeter\".  This implies that the \"radial distance per centimeter\" is less than 1.\n* The \"radial distance\" was 2.00 cm. This implies that the object is a \"oblong\" ball. \n* This measure of the \"radial distance\" was given as 2.00 cm.\n* A \u201cgood throw\u201d if it is a \"oblong\" ball and the radial distance is less than the \"radial distance per centimeter\".  This implies that the \"radial distance per centimeter\" is less than 1.\n* A \u201cbad throw\u201d if it is not a \"oblong\" ball and the radial distance is greater than the \"radial distance per centimeter\".  This implies that the \"radial distance per centimeter\" is greater than or equal to 1.\n* The \"radial distance\" was 4.00 cm. This implies that the object is the \"oblong\" ball. \n* This measure of the \"radial distance\" was given as 4.00 cm.\n* A \u201cgood throw\u201d if it is the \"oblong\" ball and the radial distance is less than the \"radial distance per centimeter\".  This implies that the \"radial distance per centimeter\" is less than 1.\n* This measure of the \"radial distance\" was given as 4.00 cm.\n* A \u201cbad throw\u201d if it is not the \"oblong\" ball and the radial distance is greater than the \"radial distance per centimeter\".

For example: \n  Original sentence: I don't like that. \n  With: We don't like that. \n  You could also ask me to suggest alternatives to words or phrases to improve the sentence. For example \"I don't like that.\" \n  You might add a comma after \"my\" in \"I don't like that.\" It sounds like this change might increase the grammar, but it might look unnatural to someone. \n  You could also ask me to discuss the sentence with me, and try to understand the context, and make suggestions for improvements, for example \"What would you say, if I asked you to do this task. \n  I'll also try to understand the sentence in context, if you want me to. \n  If you want more than one sentence to improve, you could also ask me to explain why each sentence is helpful, so that you can decide if you want to use it as a recommendation. \n  If you want to discuss the sentence with me, I'll try to understand its meaning. \n  You could also ask me to discuss the sentence with you, and we could try to improve it together. \n  You could also ask me to improve other contexts in which the sentence is used. For example, \"I'm going to go on a date with my girlfriend. \n  I could improve her as a friend or romantic relationship. \n  When you ask me to improve a sentence, you should tell me what you think it should be. \n  Here are some examples: \"I don't like that.\" \n  I could improve that as \"I don't like that.\" \n  \"I can't make this dress fit me.\" \n  I could improve that as \"I can't make this dress fit me correctly.\" \n  \"What are we going to drink?\" \n  I could improve that as \"What will we drink? \" \n  It's also possible that the sentence doesn't need improving, or that I can still improve it without changing the sentence structure. \n  A sentence can still be helpful if it has no actual semantic or grammatical errors, such as if the sentence looks normal and is easy to read and understand. \n  For example, you might want to consider \"I'm not sure what to do next. \n  This would be grammatically and semantically correct. \n  You might want to try to explain \"I don't think this is a good way to do this. \n  This sounds like a well-formed sentence to me. \n  I could recommend using this sentence instead. \n  The sentence might be helpful even if the translation is poor, or the text in the sentence sounds funny, or the language is obscure, or is written in an unfamiliar style. \n  I could still work with that sentence. \n  \"What happened to the man in that car?\" \n  \"The car was damaged.\" \n  \"Let me know how it goes.\" \n  \"We'll get back to you.\" \n  \"I don't know, why is this bad?\" \n  You might still want to suggest this sentence. \n  You might also want to ask me to recommend this sentence to others, but you'd have to explain that you're fine with the translation and that you feel like it has a good meaning. \n  You might also like to ask me to recommend this sentence to others, but you'd have to explain that you're fine with the translation and that you feel like it has a good meaning. \n  You might also want to ask me to recommend this sentence to others, but you'd have to explain that you're fine with the translation and that you feel like it has a good meaning. \n  You might also like to ask me to recommend this sentence to others, but you'd have to explain that you're fine with the translation and that you feel like it has a good meaning.\n\nTask: I will ask you to improve the language quality of a given sentence, making it more grammatically correct, meaningful, and more natural-sounding. \nYou will give the original sentence and I will improve it, providing the possible output in the format of sentence or sentences, ordered as such.\nFor example, I might say \"I like to eat chocolate, I would recommend trying that,\" or \"I believe this is an interesting recipe that would taste great with vanilla ice cream too.\" \nI'll give you an example sentence: \n@@@ Original sentence: I think this chocolate fudge recipe is pretty good.  I\u2019d recommend trying it. \n@@@ Rephrase:  I believe this chocolate fudge recipe is decent, and I\u2019d certainly advise testing it.\n\nTo improve the sentence, I have made the following changes: \n- I've rephrased the sentence so that it is grammatically correct, with the first part being the subject and the second part being an adverbial clause. \n- I've changed the tense by adding a future clause, with \"would recommend\" to indicate that the sentence is conditional and future-oriented."}

{"prompt": "Please rephrase the following sentence: \n@@@ Original Sentence: One way to think about it is this:  You can make a car without a human driver in two different ways.  The first is to put a robot in the car, which is kind of like a remote-control helicopter.  The robot would have a video camera, some artificial intelligence, and some sensors.  When you are driving, you would be able to see out the window and steer and accelerate and brake with a joystick or other controls, so it\u2019s like you are driving, but you aren\u2019t.  You\u2019d control the robot, and the robot would control the car.  If you wanted to be super safe, you could build an extra sensor in the car that would only drive in the safest conditions, and when there were hazards, or if the car sensed the driver wasn\u2019t doing what they should, then the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead.  This is the safer way, but it would also be kind of slow because the robot would just be doing the exact same thing that you would have done, and if you messed up, the robot would also mess up.\n\nThe other way is to give your car a super powerful computer, with artificial intelligence, and a pretty fast internet connection, and let it drive itself.  This car would also have some sensors, but it wouldn\u2019t really need them, because it would always have access to so much more information than you do.  When you are driving, you would choose where you want to go, and your car would use all of its data to come up with the best route and way to get there.  The computer would make all the decisions about how to handle unexpected events and road conditions, and would do the braking and steering and everything.  It\u2019s kind of like having a flying car that is in control of everything, and you just decide where you want to go.  Most people use cars like this, because they\u2019re pretty good and most of the time you don\u2019t really want to do all of that work and risking making a mistake.\n@@@ Rephrase: ", "response": " the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead.

For example, you could create a car for a hospital, which would take any hospital route of the city and find the shortest.  You could also create a car for a shopping mall, and find the most efficient route to the store.  There may be even cars that you could create for places that don\u2019t have good roads, and the robot can tell how to plan a route for those places.  So the technology is already available, and you can create a car for any kind of function you want, as long as you can program it to find the best route to the destination.  You don\u2019t have to drive, you can just sit in your chair, look through your computer, and choose to go for a walk, have a coffee, or go for a run without going out in the actual world.  The robot is not in charge of anything, so it\u2019s just there to provide the service that you want.  This is just a little bit like having a flying car, but in your house."}

You should first identify the types of surfaces that require cleaning. For instance, vinyl floors need to be cleaned after every 6-month period, while tiles or marble need cleaning more frequently. You should then find a suitable cleaner and make sure that it is suitable for the surface you want to clean. The next step is to follow the cleaning instructions. There is a special cleaner for vinyl floors, for example. The next step is to rinse the cleaner with clean water afterward. In order to minimize the risks that may occur, you should also use a protective coating when cleaning your pool. The first thing you should do is to use a hose to turn off all the water in the area where you will perform the cleaning. Then, you should make sure that you clean the pool filter, filters, and screens. The next thing you should do is to clean the deck and bottom edge of the pool. You also need to make sure that you clean the pool walls, floors, and any decorative parts. Here are some tips for you to follow. The first step is to use an acid cleaner. This is usually recommended after every 6 months. If you want to clean the pool, I'd recommend trying some of the products available from our online store. You should follow the directions for using the product. You should do all of the above steps every week, but at least once, to make sure that they are effective."}

In this specific case, the dopamine system is a neurotransmitter that works to coordinate, process, and distribute signals of various types in the nervous system.  For a small part of that mechanism, there are two endogenous receptors for dopamine that work by binding to the neurotransmitter and transporting it elsewhere in the body.  Without these two receptors, dopamine is either bound to the cell membrane or transported to the synaptic space of other neurons, which also bind to and transport it away from the transmitter in their own way.  In the \u201cboost dopamine levels\u201d sense, one could just change the \u201cenvironment\u201d so that a greater number of these neurotransmitters are released, but this won\u2019t actually change the amount of the transmitter that is bound to the receptors.\n@@@ Rephrase: ", "response": "Please rephrase the following sentence: \n@@@ Original Sentence: As in any psychopathology, one can talk about factors that promote or depress the expression of the syndrome, but that\u2019s probably more confusing than helpful.

The studies using different neurotransmitter levels show a similar result, namely that dopamine levels are increased by a mechanism similar to that of acetylcholine, with the difference that acetylcholine appears to have a greater effect in most regions of the brain.  This study is likely to provide the first neurobiological basis for this theory, and suggests that neurochemical and genetic variations may have an effect on which dopamine-regulating mechanisms are activated in certain parts of the brain.  The fact that the same neurotransmitter release mechanisms and pathways are active at different parts of the brain is consistent with the idea that certain brain regions may be connected through complex mechanisms, and that some brain regions of differing connectivity may be interconnected through different neurotransmitter pathways.  The mechanism seems to operate in a similar way as how the \u201cdopamine circuit\u201d operates, in that the different regions within the brain have slightly different levels of expression of the various pathways, and that the circuits and pathways do not operate at different rates and cannot be thought of as independent of each other.  The current study is consistent with this mechanism, as it provides additional evidence for a more complex web of connections that links different brain regions of different connectivity.\n@@@ Rephrase: Although previous research suggested that the striatal dopamine pathway control the production of dopamine in the striatum, this is now found to be affected by a pathway that is involved at the level of the presynaptic membrane as well as a downstream pathway. As a result, it shows that dopamine production in the striatum is controlled by different mechanisms from the striatal dopamine pathway, and that this information would provide the first biological basis for this theory. It also supports the idea of how the \"dopamine circuit\" operates, which is that certain brain regions may be connected although having a different connectivity, and that different brain regions may be interconnected through different dopamine pathways. The mechanism is consistent with this network, as it provides further evidence of complex connections linking different parts of the brain, which are all controlled differently, and can thus be thought of as independent of each other. This study further supports this idea, as it provides evidence of a more complex network of connections linking different, previously thought of as non-interconnected brain regions."}

I can tell you about other instruments that have a lot to answer for, and might be nice to learn to play, but these are more complex, and may take years to get to a nice level.\nI'll just tell you about a few instruments that sound interesting right now, without going into much detail.  \nThe first instrument is a harp.  The harp is played a lot in classical music, and this instrument can be pretty challenging to play.  Harps are very similar to the harps that are used in opera, which is where they were historically originally.  Many music teachers will suggest that you start with an easy piece of music, to make sure you can play it, then move on to more challenging pieces.  I'd recommend starting with something that has a simple melody and rhythm, so you can focus on the playing.  I can put you in touch with a tutor, who can help you learn to play this instrument.\nThe next instrument that comes to mind is the guitar.  As far as I know, the guitar is the most popular instrument in Western music, and for good reason.  It is very versatile, and can be used for a wide range of music.   There are many different guiatrs to choose from, so it can be very rewarding and challenging to play this instrument.  I can put you in touch with the local music store, who can help you get started.\nThe last instrument that I would recommend is the piano.  The piano is almost always used for western music.  There are a few different scales that can be used to play music on the piano, but the most common scale is the C Major scale, which consists of the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.  There are many different ways to play the piano, but some people start with the easiest thing to play.\nI'm really happy to talk with you about these instruments, and I'd be happy to help you learn how to play them.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you need any help getting started.  I'm happy to help you develop a plan to get started learning to play, or help you choose the right instrument to learn."}

Some of these nutrients are called \"fiber\", which helps us stay healthy and gives us energy. Carrots are a type of vegetable, which means they're a part of plants where they grow, and there are many other foods that can have fibers. But the question is, if we compare some foods and their vitamins, we can see that carrots don't contain as many \"good vitamins\" as a carrot does. \n\nIn simple words, the main idea is that carrots do have vitamins, but they're not the same ones found in more common fruits and vegetables.

The program must be able to discern and process numerical data with complex pattern recognition, ultimately leading to a calculated outcome of at least 25%. Be sure to also present the necessary code, containing the logical statements that enable the program to operate as it does. Best of luck with this challenging task!\nassistant\nCertainly! Here's an implementation of a simple Monte Carlo simulation in C++ that demonstrates the use of mathematical concepts like probability and statistics to solve a computational problem:\n```c++\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\nusing namespace std;\nint main()\n{\n    double num;\n    // Initialize random number generator\n    srand(time(NULL));\n    // Generate num number of random values between 0 and 100\n    num = rand() % 101;\n    // Repeat n times to reach 25%\n    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {\n        // Generate random values to fall within the range [0, 100]\n        num += rand() % 101;\n    }\n    // Subtract 0.5 to get to a number between 0 and 100\n    num -= 0.5;\n    cout << \"Result: \" << num << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this program, the `srand` function is used to seed the random number generator with the current time, which ensures that the random numbers generated are different every time the program is run. The `rand` function generates a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (exclusive), which is then added to the seed value to produce a range between 0 and 100 (inclusive). This process is repeated `1000` times to generate a probability distribution, and then a number is subtracted from this distribution to produce a value between 0 and 100 (inclusive). Finally, the result is printed to the console.\nThis is a simple example, but it demonstrates the basic principles behind using mathematical concepts like probability and statistics to solve computational problems. The program generates a random number between 0 and 100, and then adds this number to the seed value to produce a distribution that falls between 0 and 100. The program subtracts this new value from the distribution to produce a value between 0 and 100. This process is repeated 1000 times, and the result is a probability distribution between 0 and 100. Subtracting 0.5 from the result produces a number between 0 and 100, which is the final answer.\nIn order to add dynamic functionality to my paragraph template, I am wondering if it is possible to incorporate an image into the paragraph that is not part of the pre-existing content.

The native predators have always shared the same environment, and the species did not evolve to be better adapted to the islands in the way that the other species have.

The food available to the native predators are usually found in the small streams and creeks in the forest, which is not a food source for humans. If a native predator leaves, the indigenous inhabitants are at risk. Therefore we take measures to ensure that they do not leave."}

As the Moon revolves around the Earth, this gravitational pull causes the Moon's side to become tilted (we call it an \"equator\") at different times of the month.  This tilt of the Moon affects the tides, which are the result of the gravitational pull of the Moon on the Earth.  These tides are created because the gravitational pull has a torque of about 10 miles-per-hour (and I am assuming you are not talking about the Moon being very far away from the Earth).  So think of tides like big waves in the ocean.  If the tide is not strong enough to break the waves, it doesn't create a wave effect (or a \"high\" or \"low\" in our terms)."}
