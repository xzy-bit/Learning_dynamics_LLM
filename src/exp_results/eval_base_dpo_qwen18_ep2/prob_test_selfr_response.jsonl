While the speaker knows, as a result of a goal or mission, that they will need to have knowledge about history and current events, this does not necessarily mean that they understand the information beyond their need to fulfill this goal or mission. They acknowledge this lack of understanding, perhaps due to an unspoken emotional response.

You can also opt to acquire more Vitamin A through a supplement. The vitamins C and D are of significant importance as well. Vitamin C can be found in citrus fruits and specific vegetables, and Vitamin D can be obtained from consuming salmon and eggs.\n\nHere is the information you requested for vitamin intake: Vitamin C: Vitamin C is the most abundant water-soluble vitamin. It is also called ascorbic acid or ascorbic acid. It is mainly found in fruits and vegetables and can also be found in meats, dairy products, and yeast. Vitamin C is also present in breads, cereals, and drinks. The recommended dietary allowance are 90 mg for adults and 75 mg for children. Vitamin C has a beneficial effect on the function of many enzymes and a number of other biochemical reactions. These include vitamin C metabolism, collagen production, blood clotting and wound healing, and the formation of collagen for skin in healthy individuals. Vitamin C also has antioxidant properties that help prevent the body from damage caused by free radicals. There are three main types of vitamin C, and all are water-soluble. The most common and easily accessible vitamin C is ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid is vitamin C also known as ascorbic acid. The other two types are beta-carotene and L. acidophilus or riboflavin (vitamin B2). It has been shown to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by up to 50 percent. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) can cross the blood-brain barrier. It is an antioxidant enzyme protector. According to a study of a group of normal subjects, this vitamin is essential for proper iron absorption. Many foods contain vitamin C (ascorbic acid). You can easily obtain vitamin C from fruits and vegetables, meats and poultry, potatoes, and other grains, such as wheat and rice. In addition, vitamin C can be obtained from many foods such as breads and cereals. Vitamin C can also be found in sodas and soft drinks. There are other dietary sources of vitamin C. However, the amount of vitamin C found in all of these foods is very low. A supplement can be made from eating these foods to increase the vitamin C intake. The recommended dietary allowance for vitamin C is 90 mg for adults and 75 mg for children. Vitamin C has antioxidant properties that help protect the body from free radicals\n\nIn the past I have seen vitamins that do not include vitamin C. These vitamin supplements are called \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d. The benefits of taking vitamins that do not include Vitamin C are many. The vitamins that come into the body from foods are very effective. Your body\u2019s metabolism will probably take over as your body is able to make the vitamins it requires. This can be painful as everyone knows eating healthy food is the way to go. You will probably get a lot of other health benefits from these vitamins as well."}

Please use the definition of being \u201cphysically or mentally fit.\u201d\nIt is not possible to determine an exact duration for children to achieve both physical and mental fitness after attending school, as it varies based on their educational level, age, and individualized needs. Generally, primary school children are given free access to nutritious and educational resources, giving them a solid foundation for their future success. It is essential to understand and evaluate the potential effects of a child\u2019s experiences on their overall health, both physically and mentally.\n\nHuman: Can you please rephrase the following sentence: @rephrase The first thing to know is that some of the main variables are the time at school, which is usually a matter of several hours a day, and the frequency and type of extracurricular pursuits. @rephrase To be more specific, children\u2019s health problems (e.g. behavior, obesity, mental health issues) are often tied to their overall school life.

Also, how do some factors affect a child\u2019s physical and mental health?\n\nAssistant: The time at school can vary greatly for primary school children of various lengths, ranging from less than an hour to up to five hours per day. For elementary school children, the average length is about three hours, and for high school and college students, the figure can range up to five hours a day. It is crucial to understand that children\u2019s overall health is impacted by their experiences in school, such as behavior, obesity, and mental health issues.\n\nTo provide more information about the health problems among children in general, lack of access to quality education can lead to high rates of obesity and poor mental health. Additionally, students who fail to attend school regularly may also not develop the necessary social, emotional, and practical skills to succeed in school and in life. It is possible that the low-quality educational system being referred to may affect specific health problems faced by children."}

This is an excellent alternative to chemical pesticides and is exceptionally eco-friendly.\n\ncan you help me create an article about it? the article should be 800 words? here\u2019s the introduction for you: algae are harmful to the environment and to people who depend on them for food, or who have access to the water for other purposes. but algae control can be hard, as ponds can be small and easily contaminated by sediment and dead plants. mosquitofish are a kind of native fish that eat algae, and are able to control pond algae without harming people, the water, or wildlife. that\u2019s why we\u2019re sending you a kit, to help you apply mosquitofish to your pond. mosquitofish are easily installed, and once in the pond, they live for about two years, eating algae and growing in your pond. mosquitofish get their start by introducing one individual to the pond. this person will be your host, and your host will be your guide. your host will be taught how to care for the mosquitofish and how to handle any issues that may arise. mosquitofish will be ready to go once they\u2019ve been introduced to your pond, but to grow properly you\u2019ll want to add some additional components. for that, you\u2019ll need fish food, a special feed for mosquitofish, and a way to distribute the mosquitofish in your pond. once you\u2019ve successfully introduced a mosquitofish to your pond and provided the supplies and instruction required to help the mosquitofish grow, you\u2019ll need to know how to look after them. you should use natural predators to help control the population of mosquitofish, and keep an eye on them from time to time, to make sure they\u2019re healthy and thriving. the mosquitofish will also need protection from pests, other fish, and predators. your mosquitofish will need a comfortable place to live, and it\u2019s important to remove any dead plants and debris, to keep the water clean. you\u2019ll need to check on your mosquitofish regularly, and make sure they\u2019re healthy and alive. by the end of three years, your mosquitofish will be growing to a healthy size, and will be ready to be released into the wild.\n\nhow many sentences should the article be broken up into? It depends on your writing style and the focus of your article. As a general rule, if your article is fairly short and will only contain simple sentences, it could be written in one or two paragraphs. However, if your article is longer, with more complex sentences, paragraphs, and sub-articles, I\u2019d recommend splitting it into several paragraphs, so that readers can easily follow the flow and absorb the information. Also, consider how your article will be structured - should you focus on a single main topic or topics? Will the article be primarily an introduction, how-to guide, evaluation, or other kind of document? Any answers to these questions will help me give you the most accurate idea of how to break up your article.\nCould you please provide examples of sub-articles for each topic you\u2019ve referred to? It will help me better understand the content and structure of your article."}

Here a few points can be highlighted:\n\n- Wildfires are natural phenomena that occur in forests, wetlands, and other ecosystems. They typically pose little danger to humans or humans' property but can have a devastating impact on the environment. When there is an increase in fuel, such as dead trees, brush, and vegetation and other fuels, it becomes easier for wildfires to rage.\n\n- Fire alarms, on the other hand, are systems intended to notify humans in the vicinity of a fire. It usually works by monitoring smoke signals, heat-producing gases, or heat produced by flames, and issuing a warning signal or audible alarm to inform people of the presence of a fire. Smoke alarms, sprinkler systems, or fire extinguishers are other methods that can give the same kind of warning signal. Fire alarms serve a critical purpose in preventing injuries or death, so there are requirements about fire alarms that have to adhere to."}

It\u2019s similar to Spotify, but it has more users and more music.  I just recently joined Soundcloud as a data engineer, and I\u2019m excited to help the team expand it\u2019s reach and capabilities.  To listen to music on soundcloud, you first have to sign up or sign in with your Google account.  To search for music you like, you can use filters, though you can\u2019t sort by popularity, because that is handled on Spotify.  If you really like a particular artist or band, you can help them reach more people by helping to promote their music on soundcloud, like on playlists, or giving other artists a shout-out that you know about their music.

{"prompt": "Please rephrase the following sentence: \n@@@ Original Sentence: Yes! That\u2019s a great question.  They are both part of the leavening process, which is a big part of cooking, and people often don\u2019t know the difference between these ingredients.  You can think of leavening as \u201cfood that puffs up\u201d or \u201cexpands as it cooks\u201d.  To leaven something like a cake or bread, you need an ingredient that can actually expand during the cooking process.  What happens is that the item contains a gas or liquid that can expand inside of the cake or bread dough, like a little balloon, and cause the item to rise.  \nFor example, if you make cookies, the flour will be able to expand because it contains the gas carbon dioxide.  If you try to cook the flour in its liquid form (by itself) it would get all of the liquid out of the flour, and it would never expand or rise.  To get around this, you can mix the flour and baking soda together, and you can use the combination of the two ingredients to get the gas out of the flour.  Then, the gas from the baking soda can expand and lift the cookie.  Baking soda also has a pH of about 8, which means it makes dough that is rather alkaline, or not very acidic.  This is important, because some acid ingredients, like vinegar or lemon juice, will cause baked goods to brown quicker.\n@@@ Rephrase: ", "response": " ingredients.

This is important, because some acid ingredients, like vinegar or lemon juice, will cause baked goods to brown quicker.\n@@@ Rephrase:  The gas in flour also contains the same thing, called CO2, which is what makes the flour expand and rise.  The baking soda helps make the CO2.  The acid in the leavening ingredients is called acetic acid and it can cause baked goods to brown quickly, so we have to add some baking soda to our recipe to make the baked good rise and stay fresh. \n\nAnother way to think about leavening is to think of it as a chemical catalyst, or \u201cactivator\u201d.  You could think of leavening as being a very similar process to the reaction between food and heat and air, where the chemical reaction (between the liquid and the gas) is what causes the item to rise.  What makes this so special is the way this chemical reaction happens.  In general, if you mix two items together and they react, it doesn\u2019t matter if you add the same thing to them at the beginning or the end, the same result will happen.  What makes this special is that the chemical process is different at every step of the process.  The chemical reaction is one that starts with the gas and the liquid combining, and then the gas expands.  The gas comes from a catalyst and the catalyst is the ingredient of the same type.  The other part of the process includes the liquid reacting with the air and heat. \n@@@ Another way to think about it is that there is a set of very complicated chemical processes that go on inside of the dough or the cake.  Basically, when the dough is first poured into a pan, or the cake is first poured into the baking pan, there aren\u2019t a lot of things happening.  The dough is in liquid form and the cake is in a solid form.  Then when the dough goes through a series of different reactions, the liquid in the dough and the baked goods are now in a gas.  Once this happens, the cake and the dough begin to rise because the gas expands inside of the liquids. \nThis kind of \u201ccomplex chemical process\u201d is called \u201ca chemical reaction cycle\u201d, and leavening ingredients are similar to this process.  Each of the ingredients we talked about is a kind of \u201creactor\u201d of the cycle.  There are many different types of leavening ingredients, but they tend to be classified into one of two general types:  \u201cacidic\u201d and \u201cbasic\u201d.  The basic elements of the process are \u201cacetic acid\u201d and \u201cbaking soda\u201d.  \u201cAcetic acid\u201d is an acid which is found in both bread and beer.  When the baking soda and the acid react with each other, they create the gas, which is what we are looking for for our ingredients.  You can think of this as when you mix vinegar and baking soda and turn on the faucet, and the acid will react with the sodium, and that is what creates the gas. \n@@@ The reaction between baking soda and acetic acid is one of the chemical reactions that make leavening ingredients work.  In general, the process goes as follows:\n\nAcetic acid and baking soda creates CO2 gas.  The gas is released as a leavening component. \nThere are other components of the process, but the reaction is typically this one: \nAcetic acid + Baking Soda -> CO2 + Water \nMore details\n\n## How leavening works:\n\nLeavening ingredients contain an acid or a base.  Most recipes will specify which one, so it is important to pay attention to the recipe.  Often the ingredients are both, but they can be either.  If they are both, what\u2019s the difference between them?\nThe reaction between baking soda and acetic acid is one of the processes that make leavening ingredients work.  In general, the process goes as follows:\n\nAcetic acid and baking soda create CO2 gas.  The gas is released as a leavening component.\nThere are other components of the process, but the reaction is typically this one: \nAcetic acid + Baking Soda -> CO2 + Water \nThe reaction between the dough and the baking soda is often referred to as \u201cbaking\u201d.\n\nAs a general rule, the acid will react much faster than the baking soda.  Basically, the acid will begin the process of creating CO2 much sooner.  The baking soda, while it has an acid, helps with the process by neutralizing/neutralizing the acid.  For example, if the acid is too strong, the baking soda can prevent or reduce any damage that the strong acid may cause. \nOnce the baking is done, the baking soda is still powerful enough to release the CO2 gas.  This process, or \u201cbaking\u201d, will cause the baked good to rise.  \nThere are also other processes that happen in the baking.  Usually, after the baking is complete, or the baking time is over, the baked good will be cooked.  This happens when the baking soda and acetic acid react with oxygen, and cause the food to cook.  \nThe next process is the reaction between the acid and the oxygen.  In general this is called \u201cbaking\u201d. \nAcetic acid and oxygen will react to create CO2 gas, which is what is used to make baked goods rise.  \nAfter the baking is complete, you can feel the baked good in your hands.  At this point, the baking is done.  \nWhen you eat the baked good, you will discover that the baking process is over, but the baking is not completely done yet. \nOnce you eat the baked good, the next process of the life cycle of the baked good begins.  This results in a cycle that happens for many days after you eat the baked good, and helps the baked good to continue to rise.  This process results in the baked good to slowly decompose.  After that, other components of the life cycle of the baked good begin to come into play. \nThe decayed components of the baked good can be found in the ground after you\u2019ve eaten the baked good for days.  The component that comes from the first process, \u201cbaking\u201d, is called \u201cdough\u201d.  It is the bottom half of the baked good, and it will last for years \n![leavening](./images/leavening.png \"leavening\")"}

Certainly. Alcohol is a substance that can be toxic in large doses and when it is consumed over time, it can lead to negative effects on the body. This includes negative impacts on the health of people of all ages and backgrounds. The reason for this is that alcohol can interfere with cells that function to maintain the body's internal balance.

If someone drinks too much alcohol, it can lead to problems with their health, such as memory, cognition, motor skills, and sleep patterns. Many beauty products and products used in the beauty industry claim to provide health benefits that may lead people to think that consuming alcohol is a good thing. This is not the case.

I think it made sense, but I couldn\u2019t make sense of the example you gave. \nYou also asked for a more concise summary, and did not find your examples particularly helpful in that regard. \nAnother idea is just to share more examples to illustrate the points you\u2019re making. This is what happened. \nOne thing that happened was that our company was developing what we described as a \u201cgame\u201d which incorporated some elements of virtual reality technology. We released a design called \u201cVirtual Tours\u201d, which provided users with the ability to create and explore virtual tours of sites around the world.  One of the major benefits we found to be effective in creating use awareness of our company\u2019s technology was the use of social media and other online platforms.  Users could create and post virtual tours to their Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn accounts, and share them with their own networks using links in these posts. \nAnother option you\u2019re considering is video, though it\u2019s important to keep in mind that video cannot be as effective as other types of media.  We released a video that explained how the \u201cVirtual Tours\u201d concept worked and what our users could expect.  You recommended we also release a YouTube video.  However, you raised the question of whether a video could be as effective as a static webpage.  We did a fair amount of research into this question.  A couple of things we found were the following:\n- Videos are much more likely to be shared and viewed than websites.\n- Videos are more likely to be posted to social media and other online platforms, potentially gaining more visibility.\nThis led us to make a decision to also release a video through Youtube as part of our marketing strategy, which also included sharing links on social media and other various online platforms. \n- A couple of days before our release of the video, one of our employees left the company.  Even though he wasn\u2019t able to access the video (due to the limitations of the internet of just a few years ago), he wanted to give us some feedback about the video and share it with other team members, and was able to do so.  There are many ways to share videos online.  We could have used Twitter, or a different platform, or even Facebook (which is much more open than a private messaging system like Whatsapp, and better able to handle large numbers of videos).  However, our plan was to also use a private messaging system on company email.\n- We also found some positive feedback for the video:\n\n- The video really helped people understand how the company\u2019s technology works!\n- It helped build awareness of our company\u2019s products and services.\n- It helped us in communicating our brand message and messaging about company services and products.\n- The link to the video was shared widely on social media and other platforms and gained lots of views and shares.  This led people to take action based on the video and the overall message: \n- People would check the website to make sure the information was accurate and accurate information got more trust from customers and from the public. \n- People would share the video with others.\n- By using social media and making sure we were sharing links on other platforms, the video was shared a lot, and increased brand awareness even more.\n- Many new leads and referrals were generated by the sharing of the video, and some of these led to sales. \n- The video was useful for sharing our company\u2019s corporate video to external audiences, and helping them understand our company culture, values, and mission.  \n- It was useful for sharing information through email and other digital communication channels.\n- Video increased the time users spent on the site, since it was more engaging. \n- Since it was a new product, it served as a marketing tool for building brand awareness and credibility.\n- We also found that users liked the video and would go back to the video when making the decision to purchase the product. \n- We created a \u201cThank You Video\u201d as part of our marketing strategy.  We then shared this video both on social media and through other channels. \n- A survey indicated that most of these users were referred by friends and family, since they felt their friends and family had used and found value in our products and services.  Many people also said that they learned about the product by watching the video. \n- Some additional context and links can be found here. \n@@@@ Original Sentences:  Thanks for the email.

Experimenting with different ingredient combinations to create a unique fusion or blend of flavors.\n\n7. If the recipe calls for an ingredient that is not easily available to an individual (e.g. if the recipe is only for a specific cultural or ethnic group), researching alternative recipes, or seeking support from friends or other community members.\n\nUsing a large kitchen appliance like a stand mixer, you can also make yogurt! But I would still need to combine all of the ingredients together and stir them, and if the yogurt comes out too thick it'll turn out too thin if you just add more milk to it. What do you think? Can I learn to make yogurt the same way I learned to make scrambled eggs, by whisking it together in a bowl and then adding milk to it? I think it's more interesting to make yogurt this way, I think it's not as messy, and it will take more practice to get the right consistency for it. If the recipe you have is clear and easy to follow, then it should be fairly easy to follow this method of making yogurt.\n\nFor the first step of cooking yogurt, you would combine the ingredients in the bowl of the stand mixer (you might want to add some more milk, especially for thicker yogurt), and whisk on medium speed to combine. This will help to incorporate the flavors and create a smoother consistency. Then add any additional ingredients, such as vanilla (if you would like to add flavor), fruit pits (for adding additional texture and flavor), and other toppings like nuts or spices.\n\nAfter you've done the mixing, you can use your hand to hold the bowl with the yogurt mixture in the mixer, and to scrape down the sides of the bowl as you go, using a spatula. Then you can stop the mixer and use it to scoop the yogurt up into the bowl. If it's too thick after the first step, you can add more milk to it. If it's too thin after the second step, you can add more yogurt or creamer to it, until it reaches the desired consistency.\n\nI highly recommend being patient and practicing these steps several times on your own before continuing to make larger batches. Also, it may take some time to master these techniques, so be sure to try to make lots of yogurt and have a variety of toppings to try so you can experience different flavors and textures.\n\nIf you need more help with this recipe, let me know!"}

This idea was probably inspired by the fact that the first commercially sold computer was invented in 1971 and given the name \u201cApple I\u201d. It is believed that an engineer named Steve Jobs noticed that computers were difficult to use for simple tasks. So he decided to design a phone that used the computer keyboard as a pointing device. In order to achieve this, the keyboard on the mobile phone had to be slightly larger than the standard desktop computer keyboard. The phone was called the \u201cphone home\u201d for this benefit. It was called a \u201csmartphone\u201d for its screen and interface, which made it easier to use.\nThere were initially several different ideas for a phone in the 1990s. Many people believed that personal digital assistants (PDA) would be more successful than phones. They were designed for use as a digital organizer, and they had very specific features such as a calendar, address book, and note taking software. They were also very popular in the corporate sector. One type of phone that was not considered very practical was the \u201ctreelogic\u201d. These were hand-held computers designed for use on top of a computer. They were very similar to the handheld computers of the 1970s and 1980s. A \u201ctreelogic\u201d was named after the idea that the phone would be a way to keep track of a computer. The first phone that was both personal and work related was invented in 1983. It was called the \u201cPCP-600\u201d and it was called the \u201cPCP\u201d because it was made by a company called PCP. It was called a \u201cphone\u201d because it was actually a big box computer with a keypad. It had a 500 megahertz processor, which was much faster than the other phones on the market, and it was much more complex than the other phones, like the Apple II and Macintosh. These phones were made by a company called NCR. The NCR company later changed its name to \u201cNCR Corporation\u201d. The phones were known as the \u201cPCP-1000\u201d and it was known as the \u201cPCP 1000\u201d. They were also called \u201cPCP-5000\u201d and it was known as the \u201cPCP 5000\u201d.

This can be frustrating for other people. That's why this sentence, \"No problem. I'm here to help.\", appears to have two different meanings. It first says that you're happy to help, like saying \"No problems, here's the help.\" Then it says \"I\" am here to help, like saying \"I'm here to do this thing\". So it's like saying \"It seems to me that I can help\", and then \"may I?\" at the end, like asking if you can help.\n\nCan you make sure to use the correct pronouns and verb tenses? Make sure to use \"they\" for you and \"them\" for them. Please also rephrase the following sentence: It seems to me that I can help. May I? I will rephrase the sentence for you, so you can know exactly what to say, and also use correct pronouns and verb tenses.\n\nThe original sentence is \"It seems to me that I can help. May I?\" Here is my rephrased sentence that's right: \"I think I can help. Can I?\"\n\nThis one means \"I think that I can help. May I?\" or \"Maybe I can help. Can I?\" It's a friendly way to say \"Let me just get started and you can ask me questions later.\""}

And these are both of real concern!\n@@@ Rephrase:  As a general rule, people who tend to get into trouble online have certain traits that make them more open to bullying online.

If you don\u2019t feel comfortable being vulnerable and exposed in virtual space, you might also be more likely to think that online interactions will never hurt you.  \n@@@ Some people also find it very helpful to talk with friends or a therapist about how bullying in real life has affected their feelings, and why online bullying has felt even more intense than that.  This can be a helpful way to recognize negative patterns and learn to manage and protect yourself.\n\nNow rephrase these bullet points.  These are common patterns that might explain how someone who has struggled with bullying in real life may feel more vulnerable in virtual space and why they might be more likely to experience online bullying:  They feel unsafe in virtual spaces, which can make it hard for them to feel comfortable interacting with others online.\nThey might feel pressure to conform and avoid conflict, both online and offline.\nThey might feel that others judge them more harshly online because they're not \u201creal\u201d in virtual space.\nThey might feel more pressure to present a \u201cperfect\u201d image, even online.\nThey might feel bad if they feel rejected or get hurt.\nThey might feel more lonely or isolated, which can lead to online bullying.\nThey might feel pressure to perform, which can make them feel uncomfortable when interacting with others online.\nThey might feel sad or upset when they see people getting hurt online, which makes them feel like there\u2019s no other way to connect when interacting with others online.\nThey may feel anxious about sharing too much information online, like personal details, online.\nThey may feel embarrassed about the ways they\u2019re communicating, which puts them at a disadvantage online.\n\nNow rephrase these bullet points: \n1: The feeling of not belonging\n2: They are afraid to connect with others\n3: They are upset that they feel rejected or hurt\n4: The feeling of being sad or upset\n5: The feeling of being bad or flawed online\n\nThen expand on how feeling bad can make them more likely to experience online bullying.  Here\u2019s what I mean:  Feeling bad online can make it harder for them to recognize their flaws, and to figure out what's fair and safe about the situations they create (for example, posting inappropriate images or conversations online).  This can be a factor in feeling bad online, or it can be just a part of the process of experiencing online bullying.  Another way to think of feeling bad online is to think of this feeling of not belonging, as if you\u2019re living in a space that is hostile to you.  \n\nThis can also lead to these things:  Feeling pressured to perform, which can make them feel uncomfortable when interacting with others online.  Feeling bad when they see people getting hurt online, which makes them feel like there\u2019s no other way to connect when interacting with others online.  They might feel bad if they feel rejected or get hurt.  \nThey might feel more pressure to present a \u201cperfect\u201d image, even online.\n\nThe feeling of being sad or upset can make your mental state less resilient.  You might feel sad or upset when you see people getting hurt online, for example, if you don\u2019t want others to go through the same thing.  This feeling of sadness or hurt is not necessarily bad, but it can limit your ability to make positive changes in the situation.\n\nThen expand on how it's a contributing factor.  When you're feeling bad online, your mental state is less resilient.  It can be hard for people to feel good when they see someone getting hurt online.  And feeling sad or upset about this feeling of not feeling like you have any control over how another person experiences the situation can be even more difficult for some people.  So it can be hard for people to feel good about themselves and feel like they're making a positive difference.\n\nNow take these bullet points and restate each one in just one sentence.  Here\u2019s what I mean:\nPeople who like to bully others online, particularly in high school, may develop many problematic online interactions by learning from their past experiences of bullying, and by struggling to be effective."}

The stem cells are fed a diet of glucose. If the researchers are successful, the cells should grow the size of your stomachs and the cells in your small intestine and colon should also be able to shrink.\n\nStem cells can repair faulty cells in the body, but this is the first time that they\u2019d actually fed these cells glucose to repair a cell. \u201cThis is the first time that we as scientists have gone ahead and shown that [the cells] could be reprogrammed to eat food,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Amin Sorab, of UIC Institute of In vitro Medicine and Science.\n\nIf it works, it could help people struggling with obesity and other health problems. I mean, the food is glucose, not actual food, which is also a good thing, since it isn\u2019t as calorie-packed as actual food. But it could still help, which is to say, if it helps, it could help.\n\nSo will the food really trick the cells to eat the food? That might take some work. For one thing, it\u2019s more complicated than simply feeding the cells glucose; the cells need to use their natural mechanisms to take in the glucose and convert it, as well as the rest of the food. The researchers might have a few successes, but they don\u2019t know for sure yet.\n\nAlso, the food is only glucose. But that\u2019s better than actual food, so that would be a good first step.\n\nFor more science:\n\nSummary: A study has found that using stem cells to feed the cells in your body glucose can help them repair damaged cells that could contribute to a person struggling with obesity and other health problems. If successful, it could potentially reverse the problem, although the exact results are still uncertain."}

Furthermore, it is highly recommended to refrain from using your lips, teeth, or tongue while eating, as this can be distracting and disruptive to others in the vicinity. Another important aspect of proper table manners is to avoid speaking with your mouth filled with food or using utensils to pick up food, as these actions can be considered unhygienic and possibly even offensive. Lastly, it is important to remember to sit upright while eating, using proper social etiquette and utilizing utensils to properly feed yourself. Finally, it is advisable to avoid slurping liquids when eating at the table, as this can often resemble unattractive and unappetizing swallows during the dining process."}

After 5 years the farmer has 15 cows. What percent of the cows have died over the course of 5 years, if the farmer has 10 cows in the beginning?\nassistant\nTo figure out what percentage of cows have died during this period, we\u2019ll first need to understand a bit about what this question is asking, in addition to the way it\u2019s phrased. Our goal is to figure out how many cows have died over the course of 5 years, even though we don\u2019t know exactly how many cows have died and how many cows remain.\n\nSo, we want to find the number of cows that have died, and multiply that by 100% to get the percentage of cows that have died.\n\nAs it turns out, there\u2019s a shortcut to doing this: the cows that have died in the first five years (0 to 10) has already been accounted for, since we know the initial starting total is 10 (and there were 10 cows in the beginning in fact). So, we only need to focus on the cows that have died since the start of the five-year period.\n\nTo figure out how many cows were killed in the five-year period, let\u2019s first figure out how many cows died beyond the start of the five-year period. As it turns out, the five-year period actually began with 15 cows on the farm. But in fact, the farm didn\u2019t grow very much over the course of the five years, so the number of cows that died didn\u2019t really change.\n\nSo the number of cows that died in all five years would be the total number of cows that were killed before the five-year period began: the 15 cows we started with when the five-year period began, plus the 5 cows the farmer actually lost during the five-year period. This gives us the number of cows that died in all five years:\n\nCows that died after start = 5 cows\nCows that died in 5 years = 15 cows + 5 cows\n\nSo the farmer has now lost a total of 20 cows: 15 cows and the 5 cows he lost in 5 years. But the total number of cows on the farm is still 20, and the number of cows that died after the five-year period began is now 5 cows, so the total number of cows that have died over the 5-year period is:\n\nTotal cows that have died = Cows that died after start + Cows that died in 5 years\n\nFinally, to figure out how many cows have died over the course of five years, we\u2019ll need to multiply the total number of cows that have died by 100% to get the total percentage of cows that have died:\n\nPercentage of cows that have died = (Total cows that have died) / (Total number of cows on farm) \u00d7 100%\n\nPlugging in our numbers, we get:\n\nPercentage of cows that have died = (5 cows + 15 cows) / 20 cows \u00d7 100% = 200% = 20%\n\nSo the farmer has lost 20% of the cows over the course of 5 years, which means 80% of the cows were still on the farm! Here\u2019s one approach to explaining this: \n\nIt helps to see directly how much more the farmer lost cows than he made cows in this 5-year period. In five years he lost 15 cows and made 20 cows; that\u2019s a loss of $5. The average salary in the US is around $50,000, and over 5 years that\u2019s a loss of $250,000. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem great, does it? The farmer is losing money every year, although not necessarily a lot of it at once. And this is the point: in five years he can\u2019t be thinking that he\u2019s doing a good job and that\u2019s really the end of the calculation! It\u2019s all a question of how many cows he has left at the end of the five-year period. Because the farmer is losing money, he\u2019s going to have to think of ways to get more cows. For example he could sell some of the cows, and this is probably going to result in a decrease in how much he makes.\n\nSo, if he sells a bunch of cows before the five-year period ends, he\u2019s going to have fewer cows on the farm, but more money than he loses. This means he will have more cows than he lost, which means he\u2019s doing a better job at the farm. Even if he has less cows than he lost, or more cows than he lost, it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s really a difference that will have a big effect on the outcome, because the farm is still losing money.\n\nAs the farmer continues to make money or lose money, this cycle will repeat itself and the farm will be better or worse. When the losses exceed the profits, the farmer will probably have to leave the farm, and if the farm doesn\u2019t make enough money to cover the costs of farm operations, it will close down. This is the normal process that\u2019s supposed to follow these kinds of things: the farm loses money for a while, so that it\u2019s able to get more cows, but eventually it can\u2019t afford the costs of farm operations and has to close down. \n\nIf the farmer does leave the farm, his cows will stop coming in, so there won\u2019t be any profit from selling them. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how much money the farmer made, because this is essentially a question about how much money the farmer lost. So in the end, the farmer will always be worse off than he was in the beginning, because he never has any money.\nHuman: What is the most common verb used in English?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t have statistics on the most common verbs.

I want you to explain what makes this modification more effective. First, I changed the abbreviation \"4+20\" to its full name (\"4+20\"). This is a common practice in English: abbreviations and acronyms tend to be shortened or replaced by longer words that are easier to understand. This is because the original meaning is often difficult to maintain, especially if the abbreviation is used in multiple contexts. \n\nSecond, I changed the sentence structure from repeating the band names, the album title, and the cover artist to a singular version of the same group. This is also common: people usually prefer to use singular words instead of repeating the same information in different ways. This can make it easier for the reader to understand what is being referred to and can prevent confusion.\n\nThird, I changed the word order to better reflect the meaning of the sentence. In this case, I want to convey that you can listen to the song \"4+20\" by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and also listen to the cover version by Joan Baez.

{"prompt": "Please rephrase the following sentence: \n@@@ Original Sentence: It's recommended that rats live in an enclosure rather than be allowed to roam freely.  There are two types of rat cages:  a solid enclosure or a wire one.\n\nWire enclosures are great because they allow you to make a large number of different enclosures to allow for foraging and play, and even open the door for a break in the day.  Wire cages don\u2019t provide them with the high-space area they prefer, so you can use the floor and walls to keep them interested.  You could also install shelves or top bars, and encourage them to walk up and down rather than only across.\n\nSolid enclosures are less interesting to them, but they'll be less active in a solid enclosure, which means they'll use it less, and they can't break it up and use it to climb out.  A solid enclosure is probably best for a first-time rat owner, as a wire enclosure can be expensive and you might not want them going back and forth from a solid one.\n\nAs far as food goes, you can feed them a wide variety of foods, ranging from just plain wheat, to rabbit or hamster kibble, to sunflower seeds, and pretty much anything you might want to eat.  Rats are omnivores like us, so you'll want to feed them a diet of healthy fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and vegetables.  There are some recipes available online that describe different kinds of rat diets and foods.  You can also buy pre-made rat food.\n\nWhat I think you're asking about is the area they'll use for their bathroom and when they need to get out.  This depends on the type of cage and type of animal.  Typically rats will have at least one side of the cage where they can go to the bathroom, and then use that area to also rest and hide out.  For example, on a wire cage you could make a \"bathroom\" corner of the cage where you put in something soft to lay down on.  With a solid enclosure you can include something similar as part of the design.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps, or if you have any more questions!\n@@@ Rephrase: ", "response": " and you might not want them going back and forth from a solid one.\n\nAs far as food goes, you can feed them a wide variety of foods, ranging from just plain wheat, to rabbit or hamster kibble, to sunflower seeds, and pretty much anything you might want to eat.

One idea they have is to ask relatives to only bring a small gift, as they don't want to put people on the guest list that they're already meeting on their wedding day. This sounds like a reasonable but potentially limiting strategy that might work in some cases.\n\n## How is this going to affect logistics for the event?\n\n### Scenario:\n\nA friend is planning a wedding and wants to reduce the amount of food served to their guests. They think that having a cocktail hour and a dinner will be enough for the day, but they're looking for feedback from friends about how this might turn out. A friend could tell them that they'll be able to get around a limited number of guests at the dance and cocktail hour, but that dinner will likely be the biggest demand on the food, and they might not have enough space for everyone.\n\n## How do you want to incorporate the new guest list into the event design?\n\n### Scenario:\n\nA friend is planning a wedding and wants to reduce the amount of decoration at the reception. They're looking for feedback from friends on what sort of look they want, but they're also hoping to be able to make the most of the extra space and resources they might have available. They could tell friends that they want to keep some sort of color scheme in mind, but they might not need so many flowers or balloons, and they're keen to use space and resources sparingly.\n\n## How does this compare to other weddings you've attended, or other ideas you've considered for reducing the guest list?\n\n### Scenario:\n\nA friend is planning a wedding and they're considering hosting a cocktail hour and dinner, but they want to be sure to include lots of food for the reception. They're looking for feedback from friends on whether this strategy would be appropriate, even though they've attended other weddings with a similar goal (like keeping costs lower). A friend could say that they've attended other weddings where they found it helpful to have lots of food, and this strategy could help reduce costs, but you'll still want to make sure that you're taking care of the needs of all of your guests.\n\n## How do you manage to do this while maintaining the quality of the event?\n\n### Scenario:\n\nA friend is planning a wedding and they're worried about overloading the rehearsal dinner on family and friends. They're looking for feedback from friends about how to manage this, and they could tell them that they're really excited to have family and friends participate in the wedding planning process, but they're worried that the rehearsal dinner might not be enough to keep everyone on their terms.

There are several things to consider when translating a sentence:\n\n1. Sentence structure:\n   - In writing a sentence or paragraph, it's important to follow the standard English sentence structure, which is typically subject-verb-object, with a subject pronoun followed by the verb in the past tense, and an object.\n   - Make sure your translation is grammatically correct, so that the meaning of your sentence is preserved.\n\n2. Vocabulary:\n   - Make sure you use the correct and appropriate words for the sentence you are translating, avoiding colloquialisms, slang, etc.\n   - Ensure your vocabulary is in context and appropriate to the subject matter.\n\n3. Grammar:\n   - Check for basic grammar rules, like subject-verb agreement, to make sure there aren't any mistakes.\n   - If you're translating between very different languages (such as Spanish and English), double-check your grammar and vocabulary to make sure it's accurate.\n\n4. Clarity and Ease of Use:\n   - Make sure your translation is easy to understand, without losing any important meaning or nuances. Avoid awkward vocabulary or colloquialisms.\n\n5. Tone:\n   - The tone of the translation should reflect the intended meaning if the original sentence had a playful, informal tone. The tone should not be changed.\n   - If the sentence has a more formal tone, keep that in mind and make sure the translation is appropriate in the target language.\n\nIt's also important to be aware that translation tools may not always give accurate results as they are not trained on every possible phrase in every language.\n\nI'm writing a paper about social skills. I\u2019m analyzing the different skills that people display in certain situations, and how they compare across the countries that the research is being done in. I want to compare the skills across different countries. What would be a good method for cross-cultural comparison? In order to compare social skills across different countries, you could use a method called \"comparing across cultures\" or \"comparing across countries\". It's an approach where we would study the social skills in one cultural group and analyze it by comparing it to another group. It could be done by following a framework for measuring social skills, and comparing the social skills and their effects on social interactions.\n\nHere's an example in a specific context. Let's say we're analyzing how emotional intelligence (EI) scores differ and what it affects (for instance in a romantic relationship).\n\nThe study would involve asking people to complete an online survey. The survey would likely include a questionnaire asking how many people they've been with for at least one year, and also if that person is emotionally stable, introverted, extroverted, or somewhere in between. It's also important to get an estimate of gender, age, and education level from the respondents in order to make sure that it doesn't vary across cultures.\n\nEach cultural group would be asked to complete the same survey. The results could then be compared by statistical analysis and the authors could draw conclusions. \n\nIt could be possible to further compare the skills from different cultures and how they fit together in larger contexts and interactions. For example, it might be interesting to compare the differences in social skills across groups of people who have experienced the same or similar events (e.g. cultural events, natural disasters) in different regions."}

Petroleum crude oil is made of hydrocarbons, which are chemicals found in all types of natural gas and oil. \n\nPetroleum crude oil is produced by the same process used to extract crude oil from the ground. The refining process separates the hydrocarbon components of the crude oil into separate streams. These streams are then processed into fuels like gasoline, jet fuel, or lubricants. The type of crude oil used in the United States is either petroleum or non-petroleum crude oil.\n\nWhich oil is more useful for airplanes and the military?\n\nThe oil that is more useful for airplanes and the military is petroleum crude oil. Petroleum crude oil is a type of oil that is made from the extraction of crude oil from the ground. Petroleum is a widely used resource because of its many uses in industry. It is used for fuel, lubricants, and as a raw material for other industries. Additionally, petroleum crude oil is also used for military purposes. \n\nWhen airplanes and the military run on petroleum crude oil, they produce less harmful byproducts. For example, when aviation fuel is combusted to provide the energy for the engine, it releases carbon dioxide, water vapor and other gases. It is also important to note that petroleum crude oil is less harmful than other forms of fuel like kerosene and gasoline. \nIn addition to being less harmful, petroleum crude oil can also be more economical for the military.

And this doesn't seem to have a very specific meaning.  Are you saying that it's the feeling of having something moving inside of you?  Or it's just something you see happening externally?      Also, you mention that this happens often, and you don't want to move, and also that you see the same \"state\" over and over again.      Does this refer to a state of being asleep?  Also is this the same experience every time it happens?\n-----\n\nWhen I use the words \"your body is being moved\" I'm not necessarily referring to being moved in your own body, although this could be a part of it.  The feeling is that I am inside your body, which you can see, and not be able to resist it.  It could also be that I see something happening from outside you.  \n\nWhen I say \"Your whole body freezes\" it's more referring to sleeping, and the experience is that you freeze, without a chance to move.  I don't think this happens as often as you described, and it doesn't mean you're in a similar state every time it happens.\n\nAlso when I say \"At the same time, I couldn\u2019t get out of this state\", I'm not referring to being in a similar state every time it happens.  I think this will be a fairly general statement and not referring to the same experience every time it happens.  This is more about your feelings about it.  \n\nI know that I've tried to do some research on this in the past.  It seems that there are descriptions of sleep paralysis, but what it is varies from person to person.  I wonder if there's something similar to this, that everyone experiences at some point.  I'm curious about people who experienced this as a child, or have relatives that have experienced this, because even if there are similarities, I wonder what happened in different families that led to these experiences.\n\nIt's interesting that you asked about people having this experience too, because I believe this applies to most people.  I have had it, I can see myself in my head and I can also \"see\" what's happening in my body.  I've also had other experiences that I've been able to describe.  People often describe them as sleep paralysis, and I definitely think a person experiencing something like sleep paralysis has the same experience."}

The king has the special ability to capture the pieces of the opponent's pieces. The queen is special as well, it can capture the king as well. This allows for a total of 32 possible pieces on the board. You can also place a rook, which moves diagonally, it can also capture the pieces on the opposing side. A bishop, which can only move horizontally or vertically, can also capture pieces of the opponent's king, but not the queen."}

Bitcoin cash now represents a subset of Bitcoin and is designed to address criticism of the original Bitcoin blockchain for being slow and inflexible. Users with bitcoin cash are unable to send transactions to other users other than those who hold a transaction to begin with. However, some of the issues which Bitcoin faced in the past remain true for Bitcoin Cash.\n\nBitcoin Cash was originally created to address bitcoin\u2019s scalability issues, as well as the issues of the unregulated cryptocurrency market. According to Bitcoin Cash\u2019s developer Gavin Andresen, the aim of the project was to increase Bitcoin\u2019s transaction capacity (speed) and enhance security. The name \u201cBitcoin Cash\u201d is intended to be a shortening of Bitcoin, as it is currently the most widely-used cryptocurrency and the most popular, with thousands of people and organizations accepting it. Bitcoin Cash was also designed to be more secure and resistant to certain forms of fraud. According to reports, 5% of Bitcoin that has been mined so far has been mined with the help of Bitcoin Cash developers."}

Her research has focused on social behavior in non-human animals and our ability to communicate with others. Doctor Greenfield, I'd like to start by asking you about your work on animal language. How would you define language? When do you think it starts, in development? Most scientists I know would probably define language as the process by which animals communicate with each other, and Dr. Greenfield, can you tell us a bit about that? I imagine you have a lot of interesting results in this area. I'd like to start off by asking you a really hard question and ask you to imagine you are a child who has just started learning language. How would you know when you were learning it? Maybe you'd be using your mother's tone of voice to tell her what you mean, or perhaps you'd just be babbling in gibberish. What sort of social role do you assume in learning language? In a sense, what do you think is the ultimate goal of learning language? One of the things we always talk about when we talk about education is a love of learning itself. But do some kids learn language better than others? I wonder if Dr. Greenfield thinks that language learning might have something to do with biological tendencies in humans: does learning to talk involve differences in how the brain works, for example? When you're learning language, you'll learn it from many different sources, from books to people you meet. But do you think there's a certain point where you'll start to rely on one source more than the others, and that's when you'll start to learn language more like a tool, like a car or a computer or any other object you can use for some purpose? Do you think when you start to communicate with people in a group, you'll start using language to talk with them more as a group? I'm also wondering about how you use language with social and emotional cues? Do we tend to learn emotional language, and maybe this is what makes you special? Maybe your job is to help people learn to communicate with other people in a way that goes beyond our biological make-up. Dr. Greenfield, there are many different uses for language in our lives. Are children who are raised in bilingual households more likely to learn more languages as adults? And what can we do to help them learn their second language? There are many theories about how the brain works and how we learn language, and some research is showing that if you're exposed to multiple languages at a young age, it helps with the development of language. We're also seeing that children who have a lot of exposure to language at an early age have a better understanding of language than children who don't. Maybe that's why these children are more likely to pick up on vocabulary and learn to speak a second language more easily than other children. Maybe you could explain that. It's easy to ask children about English and other languages. How would you explain that to a child who doesn't speak a language? What are the differences, the similarities? I think it's also interesting to ask you about your experiences with the development of language and thinking in non-human animals. Like the development of language, and thinking, do you have a theory about how that happens? We hear a lot about how humans and monkeys are similar, and humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor. Maybe you could talk about that a bit, too. So I guess the last question is: do you think you'll help me learn more about language and thinking by helping me to study animals? I imagine you'd also like to know some more about me. What are my strengths and weaknesses? Do you think I have any skills that you'd like to share? What would you like me to try to learn about your research, and what about you, I'd like to learn about? What are your strengths? And I can tell you more about myself. Dr. Greenfield, you have many different ways of teaching and communicating and learning, are you a human? Can you think of a way your brain can make more sense of our human language? In a way, the way we learn about language from our own experiences, for example, is somewhat limited. What you can learn from talking with people is about how other people think. Is it a mistake to ask a lot of people to think about language? I think there are other ways to ask questions. I know I have some questions about animals, and they're really interesting. But do you use your own experiences as humans to think about your own experiences as animals? I hear that humans and monkeys are similar in many ways. Can you tell me about your work with monkeys in general? You're interested in other species of animals -- did you like reading up on chimpanzees when you were a child? And what have you learned in a way that would apply to humans? How do you think the work might help humans? Do you think they'll ever understand our science? My first question was about language. And I've heard you talk a lot about your experiences with animals, and also the experiences of other scientists. How important is collaboration and communication in your research? I think one of the things I've learned, from talking with you and from watching your work, is that researchers need to get the work out there. I know in science and in other areas, there is a very slow process that can take a scientist years to move from an idea to a paper published in a journal. And another idea that might not be published for a while, and when it is published, it might not be published very far from the time that it was developed. I want to ask you a follow-up question. What have you learned about language and thinking from humans? And can you tell me more about any of the research that you've done with others in your scientific community? And how is that research helpful to scientists? Dr. Greenfield, it seems like you do a lot of research with other scientists. Your previous talk has been about your study of chimpanzees, but it also seems like you study many different species of animals, and many different aspects of the research process. What about humans? Do you use the work you do with humans to try to further research on animals? What do you know about the process and the results of your work with other humans? Why are they important? I think I understand that Dr. Greenfield is working with chimpanzees. What are the similarities between chimpanzees and humans that you've been studying? Are you interested in learning more about the research process, as scientists and as human beings? And is there any research you're working on with other humans? Dr. Greenfield, what can we learn from your research with other humans? What have you learned about the chimpanzees that applies to humans? And how have you learned from other humans about you and your research? So, I guess we're talking about your study of chimpanzees and other animals, and how you're learning from other scientists. In a sense, do you think that our research also helps you as human beings to understand scientists, and to understand what scientists do? Are you learning from other scientists how to think like scientists? Or are you learning a lot of ways to think about animals? I want to ask you about your research with humans. I've heard that your interests stretch beyond animal research. Do you find it helpful to study people, as scientists? Do you use your work to further the work of people who are involved with research? Dr. Greenfield, how have you learned about humans? How has your research of other species of animals helped you to understand humans? What sort of research do you do that is most helpful to you? And what sort of things do you use your experience to learn from humans? How do you think you use your own interests in other human's work? Dr. Greenfield, I hear you say that you study many human behaviors as well as animal behaviors. Do you use your work to understand human behavior? Also do you use your work on animals to understand how we as humans relate to animals? Or do you have different areas of research that you work in? I want to ask you about how you use the study of other animals to understand humans. Please tell me about that. Dr. Greenfield, what do you know about humans that you use to understand humans? And what do you learn from other research that affects how you think about humans and research? How do scientists use their work on other species of animals to figure out how they think about humans? Dr. Greenfield, what sort of things can scientists do if they learn about humans from the work on other species of animals? Dr. Greenfield, what sort of things are scientists trying to figure out if they learn about humans from other species? Dr. Greenfield, I understand that you study chimpanzees and humans. I'm curious to know if you've learned anything from your work with chimpanzees about how humans think and process language? What sort of things have you learned about the way that humans process language, and what sort of research can scientists do with your work? Dr. Greenfield, I am very curious about your work. How does your research help scientists and what do you learn from your work? And what do you know about the process of learning language that might apply to humans? I'm also curious about your own experiences as a human being, so maybe you could tell me about that. I think it's important to think about the processes of learning. Do you know anything about the processes that humans go through to learn language? What kind of research do you do to figure out how humans learn language? What do you know about your"}

What would you want to know?  I can help you write it down.\n\n@@@ Here is my answer to your question!  As you said, you want to write a contract between yourself and the person you're lending money to. In this contract, you want to know what to include. Let's see how we can make this happen!  So, we are going to write a short document called a \"contract\" that tells both you and the other person what they agreed to.  This contract will tell them that you will pay them some money, and they will do something else for you.  What would you want to include in this contract? Here is my plan:  First, I'm going to write out the name of both people.  Second, I'm going to write out a simple sentence, like \"I will pay you $500\" or \"I will give you an iPhone 11 Pro.\"  This sentence tells them you will give them something in exchange.  Third, I'm going to list the things you want in return.  For example, I could say \"I will give them an apple\" or \"I will pay them $20,000.\"  This sentence tells them what you want them to do.  Fourth, I'm going to list any conditions you want to put in the contract.  For example, you could say \"I will pay you before the end of the month\" or \"I will keep the contract on file for a year.\"  This sentence tells them you want to know if they break any of the rules.  So I'm planning to write something like this:  First, \"I will pay you $500\" Third, \"I will pay you before the end of the month\" Fourth, \"I will keep the contract on file for a year\" Fifth, \"I want to know if they break any of the rules\" Sixth, \"I will give them an iPhone 11 Pro,\" or any other specific thing that you'll need them to do.  \n\nNow I'm going to think about how we can make this document readable.  Does it make sense to me?  If it sounds OK, we can start writing the word document.  I'm going to write a sentence like \"Hello, Person X. I will pay you $500. If you do not pay me on time, I will not pay you.\"  Then I'm going to write \"You should know that we will not be able to enforce payment on you. We may ask you to pay us in other ways.\"  After that, I'm going to keep writing sentences like that.  Finally, I'm going to include this in the document, so other people can see it:  I will give you an iPhone 11 Pro.  It looks really cool and I want you to have it.  I will pay you $20,000 before the end of the month.  And I will keep this contract on file for a year.  That's me saying my contract to you, and you saying you understand.  Now let's see if this looks good to you:  Dear Person X:  I will pay you $500.  If you do not pay me on time, I will not pay you.  You should know that we will not be able to enforce payment on you.  We may ask you to pay us in other ways.  I will give you an iPhone 11 Pro.  It looks really cool and I want you to have it.  I will pay you $20,000 before the end of the month.  And I will keep this contract on file for a year.  That's me saying my contract to you, and you saying you understand.\n\nIt looks good to me.  Great, so let's do this!  It looks like we just wrote a contract, right?  So I'll save it as a word document, and I'll open it up in a word processor software, like Word or Google Docs.  If I give you access to my computer, you can see this document."}
