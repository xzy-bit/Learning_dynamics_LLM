Migraines can be classified into various types according to size of the head, frequency of attack, associated symptoms, and duration of attack. The most common types of migraines are periodic migraines, delayed-onset migraine, and tension or sinus migraine. Periodic migraines are characterized by frequent attacks of headache that last for 15 minutes to 1 hour. Delayed-onset migraine is characterized by recurrent attacks that occur more than one month apart, but have a normal pattern of attack and recovery. Tension or sinus migraines are characterized by brief but frequent headaches that are worsened by facial muscle tension and a tension headache is a result of pressure building in the eyes and sinus. Migraines can be treated with prescribed medications and lifestyle changes including avoiding triggers and maintaining a healthy diet. Some types are more severe than others and require more intensive treatment for prolonged periods of time. Migraine can have a huge impact on an individual's quality of life and daily activities, including school, work, social life, and leisure activities. The most common causes of the headaches are: genetics, stress, hormonal changes, aging, high altitudes, certain foods. There are also other factors that can increase the risk of migraine such as pregnancy, sleep deprivation, and nutritional deficiencies. Migraine can be very disabling and it can make it quite difficult for people to carry out daily activities and it often affects a person's work.

The other option is \"real human hair\" and \" human hair from other countries like Mexico or India\" and there are \"really hard to find\" the best affordable options.

On Thursday 17th June the forecast was for storms which got up to a very high of 100 km/h, but it seems to have turned out somewhat better than we feared, and instead was more of a nice sunny day with some rain for a sprinkling, and no real sign of a storm at all for another few days. \n\nThis past Friday the forecast was for a shower and a low of 43 degrees, and so far we have not had any rain, while the low has continued to stay around 43 degrees, so this must be a nice surprise.

We went to lake Nederpolder last Saturday, with the temperatures at 25 degrees, and the sun shone in the perfect manner, so we had the perfect conditions for a good afternoon fishing.

And as industrialization accelerated and mechanization made it possible to operate stores on Sunday, the law was not enforced as much as people liked.

But to fully understand how movies are related to one another, we\u2019ll need to ask some more questions!\n\n## Using the starwars.com website\n\nLet\u2019s look at Star Wars data.  We could look at the starwars.com website and see which movies are in the database:\n\n![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/i038p3jg104725x/fig-10-repository-and-movies-and-stars.gif?dl=0)\n\nIf you scroll through the starwars.com website, you can see the movies.  You can also see a history of which user added which movie to the list.\n\n# Chapter 1: The most important event in the franchise\n\n## Most important movies\n\nWe can find movies on the starwars.com website that are considered \u201cmasterpieces\u201d by looking at their title or subject lines:\n\n![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/iy3e121gkm40893/following-title-1.png?dl=0)\n\nIn particular, the titles \u201cRe-imagining the Star Wars Story\u201d and \u201cAll-New and Exciting\u201d are really eye-catching.  These movies all have titles like that, and since we wanted to focus on the event most people think of when thinking about Star Wars, we can call these the \u201cMost Important Events\u201d movies.\n\nThey are:\n\n-  Episode I: [The Phantom Menace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQdA9f7xuKQ)\n-  Episode II: [Attack of the Clones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwHg2b8754I)\n-  Episode III: [Rise of the Phantom Menace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mCZSjXePf0)\n-  Episode IV: [A New Hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WZuJbLsRi4)\n-  Episode V: [The Empire Strikes Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=138nQ9kI270)\n-  Episode VI: [Return of the Jedi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nSx8R8Hb8c)\n-  Episode VII: [The Force Awakens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r15kWz8nQY)\n\nAs you can see, there are only six movies.  How can we tell that all of them were the most important events in the Star Wars movies?\n\n## The order of events\n\nWe can tell that each of the most important movies happened before the others, which might explain why most Star Wars fans like them more than other movies.\n\nLooking at the titles, we can see that these movies were all planned after the events of Episodes I\u2013IV.  The title \u201cAll-New and Exciting\u201d is probably not a real thing.  Also the title of the first movie [A New Hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WZuJbLsRi4) is not really a title of the most important movies.  (They\u2019ve just changed some words, and we don\u2019t need to know anything about that.)  But it is possible that the title is a good title for these movies.  It is a pretty good title, because it makes people think about this\n\n![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/1mms14977s33e3f/fig-11-english-simplified-title.png)\n\nOr, the other way to think about it is that all the movies are really about the same thing, because all the other \u201cMost Important Events\u201d movies had some things in common.\n\nThe thing in common is that these movies all had these four things:\n\n-  The Star War Alliance\n-  The Empire Strikes Back\n-  Return of the Jedi\n-  The Force Awakens\n\nLet\u2019s go back and see if the 13 movies we created so far meet these criteria:\n\n-  All the events happened after Episode V\n-  All the events had the same thing in common\n-  All the events happened at all the same time\n-  All the events were made after Episode IV\n-  All the events happened in the same place\n-  All the events were by the same person\n-  All the events were made to happen at the same time\n\nTo check if they all meet these criteria, we don\u2019t have to read the whole starwars.com website, but just search the titles.  For example, we could try searching for the titles\n\n-  [The Force Awakens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=138nQ9kI270)\n-  [The Empire Strikes Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3B3h9060xY)\n-  [Rise of the Phantom Menace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mCZSjXePf0)\n-  [The Last Jedi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cEg4Xx3G7g)\n-  [The Force Awakens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17lKZB1e8Xk)\n-  [The Empire Strikes Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=138nQ9kI270)\n\nWe can see that all of these movies are the \u201cMost Important Events\u201d movies, with only one exception.  The movie\n\n![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/r400uwyx0i2x6gj/fig-12-english-simplified-title.png)\n\nis not the most important one.  We could check that it was made after the Star Wars Alliance, but the title makes it very clear that it was a \u201cprequel\u201d and not an \u201cevent movie.\u201d\n\nIf we wanted to focus on movies that aren\u2019t in the starwars.com website, though, we could search for any Star Wars-related YouTube video.  We could look for\n\n-  [The Force Awakens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17lKZB1e8Xk)\n-  [The Empire Strikes Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=138nQ9kI270)\n-  [Re-imagining the Star Wars Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQdA9f7xuKQ)\n-  [Star Wars Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WU2Y384tDg)\n-  [A Star Wars Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nSx8R8Hb8c)\n-  [Star Wars Rebels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd6Jv7j0ZdU)\n-  [The Last Jedi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cEg4Xx3G7g)\n-  [A New Hope - The Original Score by John Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA8nD0Qr7vE)\n\nWe could see that most of these clips are about the Star Wars Alliance, or about what happened in the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, and not at all about \u201cThe Force Awakens.\u201d\n\nIf we want to focus on movies made after all of these things happened, we could use the term \u201cevent movies\u201d to describe them.  We could try looking for\n\n-  The Force Awakens\n-  The Empire Strikes Back\n-  The Last Jedi\n-  Star Wars Alliance\n-  Star Wars Stories\n-  Star Wars Rebels\n-  The Force Awakens\n\nAll of these videos are called \u201cevent movies\u201d, and none of them have any thing about what happened in the event movies before those.\n\n![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/dj82205548f688o/fig-13-the-films-which-are-event-movies.jpg?dl=0)\n\n# Chapter 2: The most popular starwars.com videos\n\nWe want to get a good idea of what movie fans like the most.  The starwars.com website has a list of the most famous Star Wars movies, and lots of users have created videos in which they list all stars in the Star Wars franchise.  We want to know which of the movies are among the most popular on the starwars.com website.\n\nIf we just want to know which movies are in the database, we could go to the starwars.com website and search for \u201cStar Wars movies\u201d.  But we could also ask other people for opinions!\n\n## We could ask for opinions on the videos\n\nHow could you use a question like this one to get opinions from others:\n\n  - If I think that a movie is the most important Star Wars movie, do you think it would be the most popular movie?\n\n\nWe could also ask people about movies the same way.\n\n  - If I think that a movie is the most important Star Wars movie, do you think it would be the most popular movie?\n\n\nThese questions can get pretty long!

Sure, here are some examples of serious stomach pain:\n\nAppendicitis: This is a serious infection of the appendix, which can cause abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting.\n\nAppendicitis in dogs: Sometimes called \"stomach pain in dogs,\" this condition is also an infection that causes abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and lethargy.\n\nAppendicitis in cats: This is also a serious condition in cats, which can cause similar symptoms to appendicitis in dogs.\n\nCan you reiterate what you said about the importance of seeking medical attention in some cases? I'd like to hear whether you have any more good examples of serious stomach pains, or if there are any specific ones that are particularly concerning. Sure, here is some more information on appendicitis:\n\nAppendicitis is an infection of the appendix, which can cause abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. It is more serious than stomach pain caused by stress or food poisoning, since it can be caused by a virus such as appendicitis in dogs, which can be more severe. There are three different types of appendicitis: appendicitis in dogs is also known as \"stomach pain in dogs,\" appendicitis in cats is also known as \"stomach pain in cats,\" and appendicitis in humans is also known as \"stomach pain in humans\". There are many different causes of appendicitis, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites, as well as other causes. In humans, appendicitis can be caused by a virus, bacteria, or parasite."}

There is an ongoing research project aimed at understanding how the eye develops macular degeneration, an age-related eye disease that primarily affects adults over 50. This research is focused on studying a group of genes called RPE65 that are thought to play a role in the development of macular degeneration and are present in the retina. The goal of the research is to understand how these gene products are related to the development of macular degeneration, as well as the potential implications of changes in these genes for treatment and prevention of the disease.\n\nCan you tell me more about the oxidative stress and inflammation research in the eye?\n\nOxidative stress, also known as oxidative damage, refers to the imbalance between the body's natural defenses against oxidative stress and the accumulation of harmful free radicals that can damage cells and DNA. In the context of eye diseases, oxidative stress is thought to play a role in the development of macular degeneration and other age-related eye diseases.\n\nInflammation is a normal response to injury or infection, but excessive inflammation can have negative effects on eye health. Inflammatory reactions in the eye can be triggered by factors such as infection, injury, or oxidative stress. As in macular degeneration, inflammation can damage the cells in the retina and contribute to the formation of drusen."}

We call this a \u201cwormhole\u201d, as in, it\u2019s a flexible wormhole.  If you were floating in space, and grabbed one end of it and held it, then the other end would stretch to the ground, into the ground and back out again.

Here's my step-by-step analysis and corrections to the sentence:\n\nOriginal sentence: Marco Ruas beat George Forman to win the tournament.\n- I'm not sure about the original sentence. It seems to say that Ruas beat Forman, but it doesn't specify why exactly.\n- If we break it down even further, we have two elements related to the tournament: Ruas beat Forman and that means he won the tournament. We need a new sentence to connect these two elements.\n   - The first part (the sentence) of the new sentence should be \"He won the tournament,\" but it might be difficult to convey the meaning of \"won\" as something is being beaten. We could think of it as an action that the person (Ruas) takes on the opponent (Forman) and thus Ruas is the winner, but this doesn't make the sentence really clear.\n- The next element needs to be the championship, and that should start with the word \"This\", and it needs to be \"The other fights on that card were Rorion Gracie vs. Jay Parker, Robbie Lawler vs. Ray Bennett, and Mark Hall vs. Dan Severn.\"\n    - It seems like the championship is being referred to by the \"cards\" mentioned earlier.\n    - The rest of the sentence is now clear, now if we include \"This\" in the sentence:\n       - The championship on the card was the \"Rorion Gracie vs. Jay Parker, Robbie Lawler vs. Ray Bennett, and Mark Hall vs. Dan Severn.\"\n       - The \"card\" in this sentence means a sports or entertainment event that has tournaments with multiple people involved, such as a boxing match.\n      - The cards are described differently in all parts of the sentence, and we need to explain the rest of the sentence."}

{"prompt": "Please rephrase the following sentence: \n@@@ Original Sentence: One way to think about it is this:  You can make a car without a human driver in two different ways.  The first is to put a robot in the car, which is kind of like a remote-control helicopter.  The robot would have a video camera, some artificial intelligence, and some sensors.  When you are driving, you would be able to see out the window and steer and accelerate and brake with a joystick or other controls, so it\u2019s like you are driving, but you aren\u2019t.  You\u2019d control the robot, and the robot would control the car.  If you wanted to be super safe, you could build an extra sensor in the car that would only drive in the safest conditions, and when there were hazards, or if the car sensed the driver wasn\u2019t doing what they should, then the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead.  This is the safer way, but it would also be kind of slow because the robot would just be doing the exact same thing that you would have done, and if you messed up, the robot would also mess up.\n\nThe other way is to give your car a super powerful computer, with artificial intelligence, and a pretty fast internet connection, and let it drive itself.  This car would also have some sensors, but it wouldn\u2019t really need them, because it would always have access to so much more information than you do.  When you are driving, you would choose where you want to go, and your car would use all of its data to come up with the best route and way to get there.  The computer would make all the decisions about how to handle unexpected events and road conditions, and would do the braking and steering and everything.  It\u2019s kind of like having a flying car that is in control of everything, and you just decide where you want to go.

He was drafted to play for the Houston Oilers and then the Texas Oilers. So it sounds like he was drafted to play for a team, right? Was it a major draft? And why? Is it because the Dallas Cowboys wanted to draft him? So do you think his college football career ended as soon as he was drafted into the NFL?

When you say \u201cHarold Pennington was drafted to the Houston Oilers, and then the Texas Oilers,\u201d which is another way to say he was drafted to the Dallas Cowboys? Is this correct? Did he go back to the state where he was born to play for the Dallas Cowboys? Was this his first or second home team? That\u2019s an odd thing to say about someone. Do you also mean something like \u201cIf he went back to Dallas, he\u2019d be playing for the Dallas Cowboys.\u201d Do you think this is the correct definition of being drafted into the NFL? If so, why would it be? And if this is not what you meant by what you said, do you want to clarify this a bit?\n\nI\u2019m so sorry that I asked this question twice, and I meant to ask you about a fourth point as well. When you think about what happened when he was drafted, do you think it was an important part of who he was? My understanding is that some people who grew up in Texas were disappointed when they grew up in Texas. I\u2019d also be curious about what was lost when he went pro. Did his fans have a hard time accepting him now? He was really successful in his NFL career. What was the culture of the Dallas Cowboys like? This is one of my biggest questions, and I\u2019m really excited to know when you were born that you grew up in Texas and I\u2019m really interested in your answer, and also what your thoughts are on where it\u2019s going to go with Dallas Cowboys."}

I was incredibly excited. \n\nI was able to record our collaboration. And we started to work on the song together. What I love most about Lady Gaga's collaboration process is that we never met before. I just emailed Lady Gaga's team and said it would be great if they could collaborate with me. They were very excited, and asked me all sorts of questions, and it was really hard for me to get my mind around that I was recording something called \"The Great Gatsby\" that is a movie based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's books. Lady Gaga was very serious when we started working on this. She was super serious, and asked me questions. I was scared that I would sound silly and not have the right delivery, and that it would sound like a terrible collaboration. But I was able to really focus on the idea that I wanted to do something that was beautiful, and I wanted to do something that would feel special.

The sentence \"on earth\" and \"on the earth\" can be used interchangeably without changing the meaning.

However, consuming this fuel can cause the engine to wear out faster.\n\nIn this rewriting, I have rephrased the sentence to emphasize the key point that the automotive manufacturers produce a fuel that suits to the needs of car engines, but this fuel is more likely to damage the engine. This way, it helps to convey the positive effect of the fuel, but also acknowledges the potential downside which might cause harm to an engine."}

I think the word \"rephrase\" or \"update\" would be better words to use. \"Rephrase\" means to change the way a word is written; \"update\" means to change only small parts of something. In this case, I think it's better to use:\n\n\"Rephrase\" would be better because it means to change the way a word is written, which could mean changing different words or altering the meaning of the sentence."}
